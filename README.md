# Tic-tac-toe
The "tic-tac-toe" project in React is an implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game. It allows players to play the game of tic-tac-toe. The project includes components for displaying the game board and game logic, as well as functions for checking for a winner and determining a draw.

### Key Learnings
While working on the "tic-tac-toe" project in React, I learned the following key concepts and techniques:

#### Creating Components
I learned how to create components in React, such as `Board`, `Square`, and `Button`, to organize the structure and display of the game board, squares, and buttons.

#### Managing State
I learned how to use the `useState` hook to manage the state of the game, such as the current turn, the state of the game board, and the winner.

#### Handling Events
I learned how to handle events, such as clicks on the squares of the game board, using the `handleClick` function to update the game state and make moves.

#### Checking for a Winner
I developed a `calculateWinner` function that allows me to determine the winner of the game and display the corresponding message.

#### Conditional Rendering
I applied conditional rendering to display different game states, such as the current player, the winner, or a draw.

#### Using Third-Party Libraries
I used the `@mui/material` library to style UI elements, such as buttons.

#### Deploying the Project
I deployed the project on the GitHub Pages platform and provided a demonstration of the project through the [link](dmitrylasuta.github.io/tic-tac-toe/.)

Conclusion
Working on the "tic-tac-toe" project in React provided me with valuable experience and allowed me to master the basics of creating components, managing state, handling events, and deploying a project.
